They argued the entire time...,
It ended with a heated argument...,
They ended the date early after a big fight...,
They didnâ€™t talk to one another the entire time...,
One of them started flirting with another person...,
One of them insulted the other in a fit of anger...,
They were both uncomfortable the entire time...,
One of them leaned in for a kiss and the other recoiled...,
One of them kept talking about themselves the entire time...,
When one of them wanted to schedule another date the other didn't respond for a week...
