They didn’t love it.,
It went okay.,
It was nothing special.,
They weren’t thrilled.,
They kept having awkward silences.,
They wished they met up with friends instead.,
One of them was on their phone the entire time.,
One of them kept quiet the whole time.,
It was a bit boring.,
They didn't really say much to each other.,
One of them just kept checking the time.,
They felt kind of relieved after the date ended.
