They had a great time!,
They really enjoyed it!,
They had a lot of fun together!,
They loved spending time together!,
They gazed into one another's eyes the whole time!,
One of them told a joke that cracked up the other for years!,
They arranged another date!,
Later that night in bed they couldn't stop thinking about each other.,
They wanted to stay together longer!,
Both of them couldn't believe how lucky they got!,
They had a deep conversation that brought them closer.,
One revealed a personal secret that interested the other.,
They talked about their lives and grew closer.,
The next day one of them surprised the other at work!,
They held hands the entire time!,
They fell madly in love with one another!
