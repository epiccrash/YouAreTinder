## Privacy Policy

We do NOT store your data.

We physically can't. We have nowhere to store it. We didn't even set up a server. All gameplay data are stored locally on your phone and won't have any other copies unless you enable iCloud or other methods to back up your phone. So even if Mark Zuckerberg asked nicely to see your data, we wouldn't have anything to show.

- Thanks for playing our game :)
